## HashMap
A HashMap in Java is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It is part of the java.util package and implements the Map interface. HashMaps are widely used because they provide fast access, insertion, and deletion operations, with an average time complexity of O(1).
## LinkedHashMap
A LinkedHashMap in Java is a combination of a Hash Map and a doubly linked list. Like a HashMap, it stores key-value pairs and allows fast access based on the hash code of the key. However, unlike a HashMap, a LinkedHashMap maintains the insertion order of its entries.
## TreeMap
A TreeMap in Java is a collection that stores key-value pairs in sorted order based on the keys. It uses a Red-Black Tree for internal storage, ensuring log-time complexity for operations like insertion, deletion, and access. Null keys are not allowed.
## Sorting and searching algorithms
Sorting and searching algorithms are essential in computer science to organize data and optimize search processes. They play a crucial role in various applications, enhancing performance in tasks like database querying, file systems, and information retrieval, making them fundamental to efficient software development.  <br>
