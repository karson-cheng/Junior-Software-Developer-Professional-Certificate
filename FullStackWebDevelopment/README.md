# Full Stack Web Development
## Module 1: Frontend development
In this first module, you’ll delve into the core building blocks of web development: HTML and CSS. These technologies are essential for structuring and styling web applications. You’ll start by creating semantic, accessible web pages using HTML, followed by applying CSS to bring these pages to life with enhanced visual appeal. Additionally, you’ll explore modern layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid, which allow you to design responsive web pages that seamlessly adapt to different screen sizes. <br>

As you move forward, you’ll learn to design clean, well-structured web pages that provide a solid foundation for more advanced development. The techniques you master – whether for personal portfolios or large-scale projects – will prove indispensable in creating functional and visually appealing user interfaces. This module sets the stage for the final project, where these frontend skills will be essential in building a fully functional web application.

## Module 2: Java web development
Next, you’ll transition from the frontend to the backend, exploring how to build dynamic, data-driven applications using Java server technologies. JavaScript and Java are distinct languages. JavaScript is mainly for web interactivity, while Java is used for general-purpose and back-end programme.
<br>
The focus here is on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which divides an application’s data, business logic, and presentation layers, making it more manageable and scalable. Spring Boot, a powerful framework, will help you simplify Java web development by automating tasks like dependency management and server setup.<br>

Throughout this module, you’ll work on a Spring MVC project, creating data models and developing controllers that handle user requests. You’ll also use Thymeleaf and JSP to generate dynamic views that display real-time data. By the end, you’ll have gained hands-on experience building scalable backend systems that interact with databases and serve dynamic content. These backend skills are vital for the final project, where robust server-side logic will be required.
<br>
## Module 3: Web APIs
This module shifts the focus to creating and consuming RESTful APIs, an essential component for communication between the frontend and backend of web applications. Using Spring Boot, you’ll develop API endpoints to manage CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and explore how HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE are used to interact with APIs. You’ll also explore securing APIs with data validation, authentication, and error handling to ensure reliability and security.
<br>
These skills will allow you to integrate external data sources, manage asynchronous requests, and create dynamic user experiences driven by real-time data. You’ll also be introduced to tools like Postman, which help you test your APIs before deployment. Mastery of APIs is critical for building modern applications, and this knowledge will be key when integrating API endpoints into your final full stack project.
<br>
## Module 4: Final project and assessment
In the final module, you’ll bring everything you’ve learned together by building a full stack web application. This project will challenge you to apply your frontend skills – using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build an interactive user interface – and integrate them with a backend built using Java and Spring Boot. You’ll also create a RESTful API to manage data and ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend systems.
<br>
This project is designed not only to test your technical abilities but also to refine your project planning and execution skills. It simulates real-world software development tasks, where you’ll build a user-facing web application connected to a backend service. Upon completion, you’ll have a portfolio-ready project showcasing your ability to build professional-grade web applications from scratch – an important step toward earning the Amazon Junior Software Developer Certificate!

## Conclusion
Experts have carefully crafted course 5 to provide you with hands-on experience in the most important frontend and backend development skills. You’ll master how to structure content with HTML, style it with CSS, add interactivity using JavaScript, and build dynamic server-side applications using Java and Spring Boot. The final full-stack application you create will combine everything you've learned throughout the course, ensuring you’re well-prepared to tackle more complex projects and confidently step into the world of full-stack development.
<br>
Whether you choose to dive deeper into backend technologies, explore advanced frontend frameworks, or deploy applications in cloud environments, this course lays a strong foundation for your continued journey as a developer. Embrace the challenge, stay curious, and enjoy discovering everything that Java programming can unlock for your future in software development!
